# COP2360 Module 7 – Group 3 Dictionary Project
## Team Members
| Name | Role | What They Did |
|------|------|----------------|
| **Justin Robinson** | Lead / Repo Owner | Set up the GitHub repo, organized everyone’s files, made sure all parts worked together, and added colors, startup screen, and Easter eggs. |
| **Robert Weinberger** | Menu Developer | Built the main menu and switch statement that connects the user’s options to the right functions. |
| **Nayobe Jean-Louis** | CRUD Developer | Coded the main dictionary features — add, search, update, delete — and created the Extras menu to populate or clear the dictionary. |
| **Leopoldo Ramos** | Extras Developer | Added the startup banner, random fun facts, and secret commands. Helped test and polish the final version. |
| **Donovan Zangwill** | Display & Documentation | Helped format the console layout so it’s easier to read and worked on writing the README. |
## Project Overview
This is a C# console program that lets you manage a small dictionary. You can add new words, search for existing ones, update or delete them, and even clear or repopulate the dictionary with preset data. We wanted it to be simple but fun to use, so we added colors, random fun facts, and a few secret Easter eggs just for fun. The goal was to learn how to work together on GitHub and get hands-on practice with C# dictionaries, classes, and methods.
## File Breakdown
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Program.cs** | Runs the whole thing and handles the menu and user input. |
| **Operations.cs** | Has all the code that makes the dictionary work (add, search, update, delete, etc.). |
| **Menu.cs** | Placeholder file from the early setup. |
| **README.md** | This file — explains what the project is and how to run it. |
| **.gitignore** | Keeps unnecessary build files (like `bin/` and `obj/`) out of GitHub. |
| **.csproj** | Project setup file for .NET. |
## Features
- Easy-to-use menu for managing words and definitions  
- Color-coded output for better readability  
- Random fun fact every time you launch it  
- Hidden Easter eggs (try typing `rjnld` or `group3`)  
- Extras menu for quick testing or resetting the data  
## How to Run It
### Option 1: Run in GitHub Codespaces
1. Open the repo on GitHub  
2. Click **Code → Open with Codespaces**  
3. Once it loads, type this in the terminal:  
`dotnet build && dotnet run`
### Option 2: Run on Your Own Computer
`git clone https://github.com/Justincase725/COP2360_Module7_DictionaryProject_Group3.git`  
`cd COP2360_Module7_DictionaryProject_Group3`  
`dotnet build`  
`dotnet run`
## Notes
We all worked on this together and learned a lot about using GitHub as a team. There were some merge and folder issues early on, but everything came together in the end. It was cool seeing everyone’s code come to life once it finally ran as one program.
